<h1>Reps-Sheet</h1>
<h2>A Website as a Daily Workout Diary</h1>

<p align="justify">This website allows users to <em>register</em> during their first visit. Once registered, they can <em>login</em> to their personalized workout diary using their username and password. The diary enables users to <em>record their completed workouts, including the duration or the number of repetitions</em> for each exercise performed that day.
</p>
<p align="justify">The front end will be developed using React.js, incorporating customizations in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The back end will be built with a Node.js-based system, utilizing REST API templates to efficiently manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
</p>
<p>(The features outlined here will be subjected to further refinement or modification during the development process of this project.)</p>
