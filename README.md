<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>A Website as a Daily Workout Diary</h3>

<p align="justify">This website allows users to <em>register</em> during their first visit. Once registered, they can <em>login</em> to their personalized workout diary using correct email and password combination. The diary enables users to <em>record</em> their completed workouts, including the duration or the number of repetitions for each exercise performed that day. They can also <em>edit or delete</em> their past workouts displayed in the workout log by fulfilling CRUD operations requirement of the project.
</p>

<p align="justify">There are 6 pages in the web. They are,
  <ul>
    <li>Homepage</li>
    <li>Signup Page</li>
    <li>Login Page</li>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Record Workouts Page</li>
    <li>Profile Page</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>In Homepage, users can either go to Login or Signup pages. Then in Sigunp page, users can either fill the basic details and get signed up to the web or directed to login. Login page enables users to get logged in to their workout diary. Dashboard shows the workout log of the logged user after selecting the necessary date (By default, users will be shown their workouts pattern in current week by a graph). In there users can either navigate to Record Workout page or go back to Home page. In Record Workouts page, users can select their past workouts and can either edit or delete them.</p>

<p align="justify">The front end will be developed using React.js, incorporating customizations in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The back end will be built with a Node.js-based system, utilizing a MySQL databse hosted in Clever Cloud environment to efficiently manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
</p>
<p>(The features outlined here will be subjected to further refinement or modification during the development process of this project.)</p>
<p> </p>


<h2>UI Decisions</h2>
<h3>Color Palette</h3>
<a href="https://ibb.co/cCmcQhc"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hZqRVFR/895bd055f3bc4832e1aa46c56ff4e4a4.png" alt="895bd055f3bc4832e1aa46c56ff4e4a4" border="0" width="100px"></a>
<p>* According to Figma <em>"Green symbolizes growth, renewal, and life itself"</em> . Also, chosen green is both attractive and simple for eyes. So, Green has been selected as highlighting color</p>
<p>* Figma also says, <em>"Gray symbolizes neutrality and balance". And gray is low contrast yet it harmonizes with any other color. So, for little parts gray is mostly used</em></p>
<p>* Then black color is chosen for text overlays but with transluscent feature. Though pitch black is dull, black delivers modern look in the semi-transparent overlays. So black is also used.</p>
<p>* Lastly, white is used in most fonts as white quickly takes user's attraction towards that text. Also, <em>"White creates contrast and balance in UI designs while promoting a clean, minimalistic aesthetic" according to Figma.</em> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>* For main titles of pages (H1, H2, H3 type texts) 'fantasy' font family is used as it's bulky style goes with buff gym atmosphere.</p>
<p>* Most other fonts are default fonts to ensure the compatibility on most browsers.</p>
<p>* Font sizes were selected carefully to ensure the modern atmosphere without compromising the readability in both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
